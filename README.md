# Bare Metal Game Library

BMGL is my attempt at creating a library that can produce bootable games.

It runs on top of one of my other projects, HWLib(click [here](https://github.com/thatcppnerd/HWLib) if ur interested!!)

## What can BMGL do?

* Basic 2D Graphics

This is VERY MUCH a work in progress. but more features are coming soon!
